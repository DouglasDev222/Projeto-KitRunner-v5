- **Event-Specific Pricing**: Events can override global zone prices with custom pricing per zone ✅
- **Database Schema**: `eventCepZonePrices` table for storing custom prices per event and zone ✅
- **Backend API**: Enhanced calculator supporting event-specific pricing with fallback to global prices ✅
- **Admin Interface**: Complete React component for managing custom prices per event ✅
- **Client Integration**: Automatic event-specific price calculation throughout the application ✅
- **Sample Data**: Example configurations demonstrating custom pricing for "Corrida de João Pessoa" ✅

**Pricing Hierarchy:**
1. **Event-Specific Price**: If custom price exists for the event and zone
2. **Global Zone Price**: Fallback to the default zone price
3. **No Service**: If CEP is not in any configured zone
